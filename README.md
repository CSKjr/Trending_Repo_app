# Android-Recycler-view-sample

* The project depends on some libraries (Dependencies) and permissions, so before trying to write any piece of code, make sure that you added the following lines :

### Permissions to add in the "AndroidManifest.xml" file to have access to INTERNET Service:
\<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

### Then add the following dependencies in your "build.gradle" gradle file :

### Retrofit (Http client) + Gson
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:2.0.0-beta2'
compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:1.7.2'
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:converter-gson:2.0.0-beta2'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.4.0'

### RecyclerView
compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.1.0'

### Picasso
compile 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2'


# Choices

* Retrofit : it will help us to consume the WebService that provides data formatted in JSON
* GSON : it will help use to convert from/to JSON, we can say that it acts like an "ORM"
* RecyclerView : here I used RecyclerView instead of ListView because the first one has a good performance and enhancements than the second one
* Picasso : it will help us to use/display a remote image into an ImageView without writing a lot of lines of code, we'll write only one line where we provide the Image URL.

# 3 Layers architecture
In this code I had tried to make a 3 layers architecture to achieve separation of concerns, modularity, legibility and maintainability. Here are the used packages :
* models : contains POJOs for carrying data
* dao : to manage code that interacts directly with datasource
* business : contains the application logic
* my application : contains the presentation

# Internationalization
To ensure the internationalization concept, we'll use String constants in the "string.xml" resource file.
